    "Using the Wrapper method for feature selection involves evaluating different subsets of \n",
    "features by training and testing a model multiple times. The Wrapper method directly\n",
    "incorporates the machine learning model into the feature selection process. Here's how you can\n",
    "use the Wrapper method to select the best set of features for predicting the price of a house:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Objective:\n",
    "Clearly define the objective of your feature selection. In this case, it is to predict the price\n",
    "of a house.\n",
    "2. Select a Machine Learning Model:\n",
    "Choose a machine learning model that is suitable for regression tasks, given that the objective \n",
    "is to predict house prices. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests,\n",
    "or gradient boosting models.\n",
    "3. Create Feature Subsets:\n",
    "Generate different subsets of features. Initially, you can start with individual features and then\n",
    "progress to combinations of features.\n",
    "For instance, consider subsets like {size}, {location}, {age}, {size, location}, {size, age},\n",
    "{location, age}, {size, location, age}, etc.\n",
    "4. Model Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "Train the selected machine learning model using each subset of features.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using an appropriate metric for regression tasks, such as mean \n",
    "absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or R-squared.\n",
    "5. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "Implement cross-validation to ensure that the performance metrics are robust and not influenced \n",
    "by a specific training-test split.\n",
    "Common cross-validation techniques include k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation.\n",
    "6. Performance Comparison:\n",
    "Compare the performance of the model for each feature subset.\n",
    "Identify subsets that lead to the best model performance based on the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "7. Feature Ranking:\n",
    "Rank the features based on their contribution to the model's performance. You can use metrics \n",
    "provided by the chosen model, such as coefficients in linear regression or feature importance \n",
    "scores in tree-based models.\n",
    "8. Select the Best Set of Features:\n",
    "Choose the feature subset that results in the best overall model performance.\n",
    "Consider the trade-off between model complexity and performance.\n",
    "9. Iterate and Refine:\n",
    "If necessary, iterate on the feature selection process by exploring additional feature combinations\n",
    "or adjusting the evaluation metric.\n",
    "Continuously refine the feature subset based on insights gained during the model evaluation.\n",
    "10. Validate on Holdout Set:\n",
    "Once you have selected the best set of features based on cross-validation, validate the model on a \n",
    "separate holdout set or test set to assess its generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "11. Interpretation and Documentation:\n",
    "Interpret the results and document the selected features along with their importance or contribution\n",
    "to the model.\n",
    "Communicate the findings to stakeholders or team members.\n",
    "12. Final Model Deployment:\n",
    "Once satisfied with the feature selection process and model performance, deploy the final predictive\n",
    "model for predicting house prices using the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "Model Selection: The performance of the Wrapper method can depend on the choice of the machine \n",
    "learning model. Experiment with different models to find the one that best suits your data and task.\n",
    "Computational Resources: Training multiple models can be computationally expensive, so consider the\n",
    "available resources and time constraints."
